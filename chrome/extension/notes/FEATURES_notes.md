    2/ ROADMAP editor Component - LARGE and SMALL text boxes;
        Large for long paragraph/concepts/explanation;
        Small for specifying a card content;

    3/ TAG PAGE -- topbar:      RISING      TOP HISTORY     NEW
        && in each show examples;     

4. SAVE BUTTON when hovered on the card main image
